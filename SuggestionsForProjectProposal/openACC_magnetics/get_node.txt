The commamd below will give you an interactive GPU node on the SCC.
This means you can run jobs on the GPU from the command line and see
the output in real time without having to go via the scheduler.

Caveat: You cannot compile GPU code on the interactive node!
        You must compile on the login node (a seperate terminal)
	then run from the interactive terminal

qrsh: request resources
h_rt: hours:minutes:seconds run time
-pe:  parallel environment, number of CPU requested
-P:   project to charge
gpus: number of GPUs per CPU's requested
gpu_c:GPU compute capabilty

qrsh -l h_rt=1:00:00 -pe omp 1 -P paralg -l gpus=1.0 -l gpu_c=6.0
